# Guide To Learning Haskell

## Take it Slow
Haskell is a completely new language and unlike anything you've ever used. You need to slow it down and go one step at a time. The syntax of Haskell is very difficult to learn if all you've seen was languages like C#, C++, or Python.

## Think Math
Haskell is easier than you think. You have already learned a language just like it: Math. Haskell's nature is very similar to the way we learn math. Think of Haskell's cases as piecewise functions for math. 

## Attitude
I definitely think that the most important part of learning Haskell is your attitude towards Haskell. I let my frustration get in the way of actually learning the syntax. I tried to force it to look like other languages I've learned when Haskell is a completely different beast. All you've gotta do is slow down and take the time to step through haskell one step at a time. I've found that writing out the mathematical steps on paper is much better then just trying to think of it in another language then translating it into Haskell.
